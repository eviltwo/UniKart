# UniKart (In Development)
UniKart is a simple asset that includes a controller for driving a kart. It allows smooth movement over slopes, and supports jumping and drifting. Works with Unity 6.

# Features
- **Basic Actions**
  - Moves forward in the Kart's Z-axis direction.
  - Supports jumping, drifting, and boosting.
  - External physical forces can be applied.
- **Simple Physics Components**
  - Uses only a Rigidbody and a SphereCollider.
  - Does not execute Physics.Raycast().
- **Smooth Movement**
  - Automatically detects slopes and adjusts rotation accordingly.
  - Implements custom interpolation to ensure smooth motion, even during acceleration and drifting.
- **Proper Camera Behavior**
  - Camera movement is tuned based on commercial kart racing games.
  - The horizon remains level (no rotation on the roll axis), reducing motion sickness.
